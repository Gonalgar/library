# Library Project

This is a **Library** project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript curriculum. The project focuses on building a web-based library app to manage a collection of books using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Add new books to the library by filling out a form.
- Mark books as **read** or **not read**.
- Remove books from the library.
- Books are dynamically displayed on the page using **JavaScript**.
- Simple and responsive design for usability on various devices.
